A collection of fun ideas for further refinements and implementation

1. Everdoc

   persistent documentation for everyday things. Take a picture of your things with your phone, feed through object recognition, return matches served from popular cloud storage providers, or allow user to upload documentation if no matches.

2. Low-cost IP Cam

   Proprietary IP camera can quickly become outdated as standards change, vendor dropping support, or have security implications when a found-bug is not patched. Use Raspberry Pi (low cost, standardized, well documented) and web standards (TCP/IP, WIFI, Power-Over-Ethernet, REST, WebRTC) to achieve interpretability and compatibility with other devices

3. RemoteKeys

   Play a MIDI instrument from anywhere. Play a synthesizer or player piano remotely on a MIDI keyboard connected to a Web MIDI-enabled browser, and pipe the resulting audio / stream the video back to the player via WebRTC. Todo: address latency problems
